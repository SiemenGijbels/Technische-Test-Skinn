    <p>Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class
        of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in
        vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2
        oz) of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%.</p>

    <p>Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of
        present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same
        period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites,
        Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the
        Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and
        universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in
        religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.</p>
